# Fresh-Wallet

Fresh Wallet is a fork of Shlomi Zeltsinger's Mybitcoin project - https://github.com/Shultzi/Mybitcoin.git

This will generate a new bitcoin wallet by providing you with a (1) private key, (2) public key, and (3) a bitcoin address. The public key is expressed in hexadecimal form (130 characters).
